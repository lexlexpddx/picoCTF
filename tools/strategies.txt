General strategies for CTF

1. Use "file" command for every new file to view file data
2. Search for strings using string | grep pipe
3. Binwalk will search binary images for embedded files and exe codes
4. Use exiftool to find metadata information for file
5. Cyberchef allows for all kinds of conversions
6. Use zsteg for analyzing images to find hidden data (steganography)
7. Remember that you can often redirect output to a file of your choice and then look at it that way!!


Metadata

1. When looking for metadata, look at all pieces (use exiftool) to see if there is anything funky


Base64-encoded strings

1. Always a multiple of 4
	- use echo piped through wc to count the number of chars in a string
	- ex: echo -n "cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9" | wc -m
		- "-n" prevents newline
		- wc counts lines, words, chars, etc (-m is chars)
2. Only uses "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "0" to "9", and "+" "/"
3. End of a string can be padded up to two times using the "=" char (allowed at end only)
4. Use cyberchef to decode potential Base64-encoded strings
